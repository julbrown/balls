# Bouncing Balls
Just a simple bouncing ball animation I'm using to practice what I'm learning in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  Currently it bounces across the width and height of the window and changes colors between red and green.
When I have a bit more time and experience, I plan on adding more things such as making it change behavior on click.
